    <p>What is it about coffee?</p>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. </p>
    <p>In excess, coffee, and more particularly, caffeine, can cause problems. But the fretting about two or three cups a day, or even more, is fading as study results suggestive of health benefits from coffee keep on coming in. In 2011, researchers reported findings that coffee drinking is associated with a lower risk of depression among women, a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer among men, and a lower risk of stroke among men and women. Go back a little further, and you'll come across reports of possible (it's not a done deal) protective effects against everything from Parkinson's disease to diabetes to some types of cancer .</p>
    <p>Caffeine has been studied more than any other ingredient in coffee, and it tends to get credit if the body part benefited is the brain. But coffee contains literally a thousand different substances, and some of the lesser lights are thought to be responsible for healthful effects in other parts of the body. Some studies show caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee as having the same effect, which suggests that something else in coffee is involved.</p>
    <p>It gets complicated, though. Caffeine and some of these other substances in coffee seem to have their good and bad sides, and coffee's overall effect may depend on how much they cancel each other out.</p>

    <p>Coffee: A disease-by-disease report card</p>
    <p>Alzheimer's disease</p>
    <p>Human and animal studies show hints of protection. Some preliminary evidence suggests activity against beta-amyloid plaque that may have a causative role in Alzheimer's.</p>
    <p>Cancer</p>
    <p>Studies suggest a lower risk for some cancers (endometrial, aggressive prostate, estrogen-negative breast), but not others (esophageal). Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances could be responsible for possible anticancer activity.</p>

    <p>Diabetes</p>
    <p>Effects on insulin and blood sugar levels that would promote diabetes seem to be temporary. Regular use is associated with lower risk, and high intake (3–6 cups a day) seems to have a greater effect. Protection may come from increases in the hormone adiponectin and other factors that affect insulin and blood sugar levels.</p>
    <p>Heart attack</p>
    <p>Coffee drinking increases some factors (homocysteine) associated with higher risk. But moderate consumption (1–3 cups a day) has been linked to a small decrease in risk. The evidence for a possible protective effect is stronger for women.</p>
    <p>Liver disease</p>
    <p>Coffee drinking is associated with lower levels of enzymes that indicate liver damage and inflammation. Coffee may improve response to some treatments for hepatitis C. Findings suggest some protection against liver cancer. Cafestol and kahweol, substances found in unfiltered coffee, may be responsible for liver benefits.</p>

    <p>Parkinson's disease</p>
    <p>Studies show a moderate (25%) decrease in risk for coffee drinkers. The effect is less in women. Research has found evidence of activity in the part of the brain affected by Parkinson's.</p>
    <p>Stroke</p>
    <p>Moderate consumption (3–4 cups a day) is associated with lower risk. But chance of a stroke may increase immediately after intake, particularly among infrequent consumers.</p>
