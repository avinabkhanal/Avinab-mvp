<p>3. Peixoto Coffee Roasters – Chandler – Arizona, USA</p>
<p>Coffee here comes from the owner’s family farm in Brazil, Fazenda Sao José da Boa Vista.</p>
<p>At Peixoto (pronounced pay-sho-tow), they grow their own coffee, import it and roast it especially for the store. A true crop-to-cup experience that tastes incredible. It’s a sustainable family business that is an absolute delight.</p>
<p>You can also buy bags to take home, but with the coffee store looking as good as it is, you’ll be tempted to take a seat</p>

<p>5. NEGRO Cueva de café – Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>
<p>A wonderfully comfortable and cosy cafe that does great baked goods, breakfasts and lunch. The food might draw you in at first, but it’s the coffee you’ll be wanting to stay for. While everything they do is superb, look out for their espresso as something that simply can’t be missed.</p>
